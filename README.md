The dataset used was collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. 
It helped to monitor human activity. 
Steps followed:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Files present in this repository: 
1. codebook.md --- describes all the variables, data, and work that was performed by me to clean the data up.
2. run_analysis.R --- has the entire data prepared with the steps as mentioned above.
3. FinalData.txt -- exported final data after the steps were performed.
